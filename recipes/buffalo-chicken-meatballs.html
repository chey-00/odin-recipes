<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<p><ul>
    <p><li>cooking spray</li></p>
    <p><li>2 ¼ cups Buffalo wing sauce, divided</li></p>
    <p><li>½ cup butter</li></p>
    <p><li>¼ cup honey</li></p>
    <p><li>⅔ cup bread crumbs</li></p>
    <p><li>⅓ cup finely chopped celery</li></p>
    <p><li>⅓ cup finely chopped green onions</li></p>
    <p><li>¼ cup crumbled blue cheese</li></p>
    <p><li>2 large eggs</li></p>
    <p><li>2 pounds ground chicken</li></p>
    <p><li>¾ teaspoon kosher salt</li></p>
    <p><li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li></p>

</ul></p>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<p><ol>
    <p><li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with foil and spray lightly with cooking spray.</li></p>
    <p><li>Combine 2 cups Buffalo sauce, butter, and honey in a slow cooker. Cover and set to High while you prepare the meatballs.</li></p>
    <p><li>Combine bread crumbs, celery, green onions, blue cheese, eggs, and remaining 1/4 cup Buffalo sauce in a large bowl; stir until well combined. Add chicken, salt, and pepper; mix well. Wet your hands and form mixture into 1 1/2-inch meatballs; you should get about about 44. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet.</li></p>
    <p><li>Bake meatballs in the preheated oven until they're holding together well and are lightly browned, about 8 minutes; they will not be cooked through at this point.</li></p>
    <p><li>Transfer meatballs to the slow cooker and stir well to combine with the sauce. Reduce heat to Low and cook until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the centers reads at least 160 degrees F (71 degrees C), 1 to 2 hours. Keep warm until ready to eat.</li></p>

<h2>Cook's Notes:</h2>
<p>You could use this mixture and form patties for Buffalo chicken sliders!</p>
<p>We used Frank's(R) RedHot(R) Buffalo Sauce but any favorite wing sauce will work.</p>
<p>Make Ahead Idea: Follow steps 1, 3, and 4, and then freeze the partially cooked meatballs. When ready to use, add to the slow cooker with the sauce.</p>
